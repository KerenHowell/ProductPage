<!-- About Marie Curie -->
<div id ="tribute-info">
<p> 
    Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize twice, once for Chemistry and once for Physics.  She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and remains the only woman to win it twice in different fields.
</p>
<h3 class="header-type">Early life</h3>
<p>Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland, at that time part of the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867.  Her family had lost their property and fortunes due to their involvement in patriotic action aimed at securing Polish independence and Maria and her four siblings had to struggle to get ahead in life. As women, It was particularly difficult for Maria and her sisters .</p>

<p>Maria and her sister, Bronislawa, made an agreement that they would 
    support each other financially to permit them to continue their 
    education.  Maria worked as a governess while Bronislawa 
    studied medicine in Paris, then in 1891 Maria was able to join her 
    sister and brother-in-law.  Now known as Marie, she obtained her 
    first degree in 1893, followed by a second degree in 1894.  </p>
<h3 class="header-type">Pierre Curie</h3>
<p>It was while looking for laboratory space that she was introduced to 
    Pierre Curie, who was able to find space for her to continue her work. 
    eir mutual interest in science brought them together;  
    they were married in July 1895.  Marie’s dark-blue wedding costume 
    later became her laboratory outfit. 
    In 1897, their first daughter Irene was born. Marie’s second daughter, Eve was born. Marie was careful to ensure 
        her daughters were aware of their Polish heritage, making sure that they 
        spoke Polish and went on visits to Poland. </p>
<h3 class="header-type">Research</h3>
<p>Marie Curie was interested in the properties of then-newly discovered 
    radiation and decided to research uranium rays as her thesis topic.  
    She had determined that two uranium minerals, pitchblende and 
    torbernite, were more active than uranium, therefore these minerals must 
    contain small amounts of substances more active than uranium.  S
    he set out to find them.  Pierre, intrigued by her work,  
    abandoned his own work on crystals to join her and after processing 
    tonnes of pitchblende ore, in 1898, succeeded in demonstrating the 
    existence of first polonium and then radium.</p>
<h3 class="header-type">Awards and Honours</h3>
<p>In  June1903 she was awarded her doctorate and the Curies were invited 
    to the Royal Institute in London to give a speech on radioactivity - 
    a word which they had coned in the course of their work.  As a woman, 
    Marie was not permitted to speak so Pierre gave the address.  
    In December of that year, the Curies shared the Nobel Prize for physics 
    Henri Becquerel.  Initially, Marie was not nominated- however, Pierre 
    complained and Marie’s name was added.</p>
<h3 class="header-type">Continuing work</h3>
<p>In 1906, Pierre, who had been given a professorship and chair in physics
     by the University of Paris in 1905, was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle
     while crossing the road and died.  The University offered Pierre’s post
      Marie, who accepted it, becoming the first female professor at the 
      University of Paris.</p>

<p> Marie continued her research into radioactivity.  During World War I,
     she developed mobile radiography units, bringing X-ray equipment to 
     battlefield surgeons and training women as aides. 
     She produced hollow needles containing radon &#40given off by radium&#41
     to be used for sterilising infected tissue. She was never recognised by 
     the French government for her war effort.</p>
<h3 class="header-type">Later life</h3>
<p> After the war, Marie continued research into radium and radioactivity.  
    The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of 
    her work and she had taken no safety measures - she had carried test 
    tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket and stored them in 
    her desk drawer.  Her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous 
    to handle. Even her cookbooks are highly radioactive.Her papers are
     kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must
    wear protective clothingShe was also exposed to unshielded X-rays
     during her work in the war, which is likely to have caused her death
      in 1934 from aplastic anaemia.  She was 66 years old.</p>

<p>She is interred in the Pantheon, the first woman to so honoured on her 
    own merits</p>

    <p>The Curies did not patent their discoveries and Marie provided radium from her own supply to treat patients. During her career, Marie Curie discovered the effects of radium on cancerous tumours.  
        A charity in her name provides care and support to the terminally ill and their families.
